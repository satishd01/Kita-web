Privacy Policy
Where Connections Begin, Trust is Built: KITA’s Privacy Promise
Welcome to KITA (“we,” “us,” or “our”). At KITA, we believe that the joy of exploration is best shared safely and responsibly. This Privacy Policy explains in clear, comprehensive terms how we collect, use, store, disclose, and protect the personal data you provide when you download, register for, access, or use our social media platform (the “App” or “website” or “social media handles”). It also describes the choices and rights you have regarding that data. 
By creating a KITA account, browsing available trips, hosting group travel events, using our in-App chat or safety features (including our Verified ID system and SOS button), or otherwise interacting with KITA, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with any part of this policy, please do not use or access the App or website.
This policy applies uniformly to every individual who interacts with KITA—whether you are a host organizing a trip or event, a guest seeking travel companions, or an invited participant evaluating an event invitation. It covers all means by which we collect personal data: directly from you (for example, when you sign up or verify your identity), automatically through your device (such as location and usage logs), and from third-party sources (for instance, identity verification partners).
Please review this Privacy Policy carefully. We encourage you to check back periodically, as we may update this policy to reflect changes in our practices, new regulatory requirements, or enhancements to our services. The “Last Updated” date at the top of this page indicates when this policy was most recently revised. Your continued use of KITA after any changes will constitute your acceptance of those updates. 

DEFINITIONS
To ensure transparency and clarity in how we manage your data, we’ve outlined some key terms used in this Privacy Policy:
1.	Personal Data:  Any information that can identify you as an individual or relate to you in any way. This includes, but is not limited to, your name, email address, phone number, social media handles, and other identifiers that help us connect with you and provide you with the best event experience. Think of it as any piece of information that helps us personalize our services for you—whether you're an host or individual signing up for trips or events.
2.	Data Principal: You are the Data Principal — the traveller, the host, the explorer. Whether you’re joining a group trip, hosting an event, or simply navigating the KITA platform, you are at the heart of our ecosystem. As the individual to whom the personal data belongs, your rights, privacy, and trust guide every decision we make. This policy is designed to protect your journey — both on the road and online.
3.	Data Fiduciary: KITA is your Data Fiduciary — the trusted navigator managing your personal data with care, purpose, and responsibility. As the platform that connects you with like-minded travellers and safe journeys, we collect, process, and safeguard your data to enhance your experience. From matching you with the right trip or event to keeping you informed and secure, every action we take is rooted in transparency and trust.
4.	Consent Manager: Your personal control tower within KITA — the Consent Manager empowers you to decide how your data travels. Whether you’re boarding a new trip, updating your preferences, or choosing who can see what, this system puts you in the pilot’s seat. Grant, review, or withdraw your consent anytime — because at KITA, your journey and your data always follow your lead.
By defining these terms, we’re making your journey with KITA clearer, smoother, and safer. Whether you’re hosting an adventure, joining one, or just exploring new connections, your privacy isn’t just protected — it’s prioritized, every step of the way. Let’s make meaningful travel, together, with trust at the core. 

SCOPE & APPLICABILITY
This Privacy Policy applies to all individuals who interact with the KITA platform, whether through our mobile application or social media interfaces. It governs the collection, processing, storage, transfer, and deletion of personal data provided by or generated from such interactions. Specifically, this Policy applies to the following user activities: 
1.	Account Creation on the KITA Mobile Application: When individuals register for an account on the KITA app, we collect and process personal data necessary to authenticate identity, create a unique user profile, and provide core functionality of the platform. This may include, but is not limited to:
•	Full name, email address, mobile number
•	Date of birth and gender (for personalization and safety)
•	A profile picture and bio (optional)
•	Identity documents for verification purposes
•	Consent preferences and communication settings
2.	Hosting Trips or Events on the Platform: Users who choose to host trips or events on KITA provide additional information necessary to create, manage, and display trip-related content. This may include:
•	Trip/event details such as title, location, dates, itinerary, and eligibility criteria
•	User-generated content such as photos, event descriptions, and rules for participants
•	Host preferences regarding participant selection or communication
Such information is processed to display listings, match interested users, and allow communication while maintaining safety and transparency within the community.
3.	Joining or Expressing Interest in Trips or Events: Users browsing or interacting with existing trip/event listings may share or generate data including:
•	Event search filters and travel preferences
•	Expressions of interest such as "Join Request," "Bookmark," or “Chat with Host”
•	Ratings and reviews after attending a trip
•	Emergency contact details (used only during trips, e.g., in SOS functionality)
This data enables personalized recommendations, facilitates communication between users, and ensures compliance with safety protocols and community standards. 
4.	Browsing KITA’s Social Media Interfaces: Individuals interacting with KITA’s public content on integrated social media apps or platforms (such as Instagram, YouTube, or embedded in-app media feeds) may have their interactions tracked via:
•	Cookies, device information, or interaction logs (when permitted)
•	Likes, shares, comments, or follows on publicly accessible content
•	Voluntary submission of feedback, contest entries, or messages
Such data is used for analytics, marketing insights, improving user engagement, and responding to queries submitted via social media.

5.	Processing Personal Data of Minors: The KITA platform is intended for use by individuals who have attained the age of digital consent as defined under applicable laws. KITA does not knowingly collect or process personal data from individuals who are minors without appropriate consent. However, KITA does not independently verify the age of users at the time of registration.
If a user is a minor under applicable law, it is solely the responsibility of the user and their parent or legal guardian to ensure that appropriate, informed consent has been obtained prior to creating an account or submitting any personal information.
In the event that we become aware that a minor has provided personal data without the necessary parental or guardian consent, we reserve the right to suspend or delete the account and securely erase the associated data. Parents or guardians may contact us at any time to review, modify, or request deletion of their child’s information. By using the platform, users (and where applicable, their legal guardians) accept full responsibility for compliance with age-related data protection requirements. KITA shall not be held liable for any consequences arising from false declarations or failure to obtain proper consent.
6.	Advertisements in the App: KITA may include third-party advertisements, promotional banners, or sponsored content within its mobile application or associated platforms. These ads may be contextually targeted based on user interactions, preferences, or general usage patterns. While we aim to ensure that such content is relevant and safe, users are advised that any interaction with third-party ads may lead them to external websites or services governed by separate privacy practices. KITA does not control these external entities and bears no responsibility for any consequences arising from user engagement with such advertisements. Users may have the option to manage or limit ad personalization through in-app settings or device-level controls, where applicable.

7.	Advertisement through 3rd party: KITA may partner with third-party advertising networks or marketing platforms to display ads, promote events, or reach wider audiences through external channels such as social media, websites, or mobile applications. These third-party partners may collect limited user interaction data (such as impressions, clicks, or engagement patterns) through cookies or other tracking technologies, solely for the purpose of campaign performance and audience targeting. While KITA ensures such partners adhere to applicable data protection standards, any data processing conducted by them is governed by their respective privacy policies. Users may choose to limit or opt-out of such data-based advertisement practices through platform-specific settings (e.g., Google Ads, Meta Ads preferences) or by contacting us directly for assistance.

DATA WE COLLECT FROM YOU?
To provide a seamless, safe, and personalized experience on the KITA platform, we collect certain categories of personal and non-personal information from users. This data helps us enable core features such as trip hosting, user matching, chat functionality, emergency safety tools, and user support. Whether you’re creating a profile, exploring upcoming trips, hosting an event, or interacting through our in-app chat, the information we collect allows us to enhance your experience, ensure community safety, and maintain the integrity of our platform. Here's a breakdown of the data we gather, in full compliance:
1.	Personal Identifiable Information: When you sign up for and use the KITA app, we collect personal information that directly or indirectly identifies you as an individual. This information is necessary to create your account, verify your identity, facilitate connections, and ensure safety during trips and events. The types of personal information we may collect include, but are not limited to:
•	Full Name – for identification and profile creation.
•	Email Address – for login, account notifications, communication, and verification purposes.
•	Phone Number – to enhance account security, enable OTP-based login, and facilitate urgent communication during trips.
•	Date of Birth – it is requested only to confirm that the user is above 16 years of age, which is a mandatory requirement for account creation and safety compliance. Additionally, it allows us to send optional birthday notifications to enhance user experience.
•	Gender – as our platform is female-led and prioritizes safety, female users can sign up directly, while male users must be invited by a verified female user. Collecting gender at sign-up is a core functional requirement to enforce this system and ensure community trust and safety. 
•	Profile Photo – for visual identification and to help users connect authentically.
•	Government-Issued ID or Verification Documents – for identity verification through our “Verified ID” feature aimed at promoting safety. 
•	Emergency Contact Details – including name, phone number, and relationship, to enable the functioning of our SOS safety feature in emergencies.
•	User Ratings and Reviews – gathered during or after trips/events to promote transparency, accountability, and trust within the community.
•	Biometric Data – such as face recognition or finger prints or government-issued ID photos submitted for verification, solely for identity authentication purposes.
•	Location Data (only when actively shared) –  we do not request or store specific residential addresses. Instead, we may collect approximate location data (city/region) to suggest relevant experiences, events, and plans nearby. This is necessary for the app’s functionality, as the platform is designed to connect users to real-world, location-based activities. Location data may also be shared when users actively check-in or during emergencies via the SOS feature, to aid coordination and response. 
•	Your Preferences in App – We collect information about your selected interests and preferences within the app, such as preferred sports, types of events, concerts, or activities. This helps us personalize your experience and recommend content or opportunities aligned with your interests.
We collect this information either directly from you (via registration forms, settings, or trip preferences) or through interactions within the app. You have the right to access, modify, or request deletion of your personal data, subject to applicable laws and platform policies.
KITA ensures that personal data is collected only for specified, lawful purposes, and is processed in a manner that is adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary in relation to those purposes.
2.	Device & Usage Data: When you interact with the KITA platform—whether browsing trips, chatting with fellow users, or navigating the app—certain technical and behavioural data is automatically collected to help us understand how the platform is being used and to continuously improve performance, security, and user experience.
This Usage Data includes, but is not limited to:
•	IP Address – to identify the general location of access, detect suspicious activity, and enhance security protocols.
•	Device Information – such as device type, operating system, device ID, screen resolution, and hardware specifications, which helps in optimizing app performance across different devices.
•	Browser Type and App Version – for troubleshooting compatibility issues and improving functionality.
•	Time Zone and Language Preferences – to personalize user experience and display relevant content based on local settings.
•	Interaction Data – such as pages visited, features used, trip/event views, clicks, scroll behaviour, and time spent on various sections of the app, which allows us to analyse user preferences and improve interface design.
•	Crash Reports and Error Logs – automatically collected when the app encounters technical issues, helping our development team resolve bugs efficiently.
3.	User-Generated Content: KITA enables users to actively contribute content as part of their experience on the platform, whether by sharing memories from trips, engaging in community discussions, or hosting events.

1.	Service Delivery: The primary purpose of collecting and processing your information is to ensure the smooth and efficient delivery of KITA’s services. This includes:
•	Account Management and Personalization: We use your personal details (such as name, email, and preferences) to create and manage your account, customize your experience, and provide you with tailored trip and event recommendations.

The data helps us match users with compatible trips based on location, dates, and interests, enhancing the overall experience.

This feature ensures that you can access relevant information based on your current location.

•	Technical Maintenance and Updates: We use the data to maintain and improve the technical functionality of the app. This includes performing routine updates, debugging, resolving issues, and ensuring the app is secure and operating optimally. Your device and usage information help us identify potential performance improvements and address any glitches in the user experience.

•	Security and Safety: In order to ensure a safe environment for users, we use your data to detect any fraudulent activity or violations of the app’s terms of service. This includes monitoring user behavior, tracking suspicious activities, and enforcing the app's security protocols.

•	Service Improvements: By analyzing aggregated usage data and feedback, we continuously enhance KITA’s features and functionality. This includes making improvements based on how users interact with the app, which features are most frequently used, and where enhancements are needed. This ongoing development ensures KITA remains a user-friendly, effective platform.

2.	Personalization: At KITA, we believe that every user’s journey should feel personal, relevant, and engaging. To achieve this, we use the information we collect to offer a customized experience across various parts of the app and social media. Personalization helps ensure that users feel more connected, find better travel matches, and enjoy features that are aligned with their interests, preferences, and behavior. Here’s how personalization works on KITA:

•	Enhanced Search & Filtering Results: When you search for trips or explore events, KITA can optimize and reorder the results using data such as your location, search history, and previous bookings, making it easier for you to find relevant results faster.

•	Relevant Content and Social Suggestions: Based on your interests and social behaviour, you may see content from like-minded users, suggested travel groups, or event hosts who align with your profile. This promotes meaningful connections within the community and encourages shared experiences.

•	Behavioural Insights for Better Matching: If you’re a trip host, KITA may use personalization to recommend potential participants who match your trip’s intent or vibe. Conversely, if you're a participant, it helps us recommend hosts or events that suit your expectations.

•	Language & Cultural Preferences: Where applicable, we may adapt the language or cultural references shown to you depending on your selected preferences, region, or app usage, ensuring that communication feels natural and inclusive.

All reviews must be based on your genuine, firsthand experience, and reflect your honest opinion regarding the trip, host, or overall experience.
KITA does not independently verify whether a user has actually attended a trip or event. Once a user is added to a trip or event group, a confirmation prompt is sent by the platform or via email after the scheduled completion of the event, asking whether the user attended.

•	☁️ Cloud – Below average / less satisfactory experience
•	🌤️ Sunny Cloud – Neutral / average experience
•	☀️ Sun – Good experience
•	⭐ Star – Best experience

KITA encourages users to rate honestly and thoughtfully, based on their actual experience.

d.	Platform Moderation
While KITA does not interfere with the substance of user opinions, it reserves the right to moderate, hide, or remove reviews and ratings that:

•	Violate any of the platform's policies or applicable laws.
•	Appear to be fake, incentivized, or part of a coordinated review manipulation effort.

c.	Ongoing Verification:
We reserve the right to request updated verification at any time if suspicious activity is detected or to maintain platform integrity. Failure to comply with verification requests may result in temporary account suspension or limitations on access to services.

d.	Data Handling & Security:
All KYC and biometric data submitted by users is securely stored using encrypted systems and is processed strictly for identification and safety purposes. As part of the verification process, your documents and data may be securely shared with trusted third-party service providers solely for the purpose of verifying their authenticity. These third parties are bound by strict confidentiality and data protection obligations. Your information will not be shared for any other purpose without your explicit consent, except as required by applicable law.

e.	Host Verification Requirement:
Users intending to host trips or events must complete the full KYC process, including biometric verification, prior to approval. This ensures that all hosts are credible and accountable for the experiences they offer.

KITA’s verification systems are intended to build trust among users and protect against misuse of the platform. However, while we take reasonable steps to verify identities, we do not guarantee the accuracy or honesty of every user.

•	Harassment or Threatening Behavior: Any form of physical, verbal, sexual, or emotional abuse or threats made towards other users, whether online or in person during events.
•	Fraud or Misrepresentation: Providing false information, impersonating others, using forged documents, or misusing the platform for scams or deceptive practices.

Each report of misconduct is carefully reviewed by KITA’s moderation team. Based on the nature and frequency of the violations, KITA may apply progressive disciplinary measures, which may include a warning, suspension, or permanent account termination.

In urgent cases involving threats to safety, fraud, or legal obligations, KITA may initiate an immediate suspension without prior notice or opportunity for correction.

Users will be informed of the reason for their suspension via registered email or in-app notification, wherever feasible. Users may submit an appeal through the Help & Support section if they believe the suspension was imposed in error. Appeals are reviewed objectively and responded to within a reasonable time frame.
